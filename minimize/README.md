Minimize
--------

Minimizing existing JavaScript is a common task. After all the format of the code arriving at the client is irrelevant. All that matters is the functionality of the code. Since we also might want to protect our code from being understood to easily, renaming variables and minimizing code formatting to the bare minimum are desired.

In the provided example we will minimize a single file called app.js using the `uglify()` constructor, provided by the plugin with essentially the same name.
