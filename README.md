GulpSamples
===========

A few gulpfile.js samples to showcase gulp

These samples have been prepared for my talks about gulp. Each sample lives in its own directory. Look at the `gulpfile.js` or the `README.md` of the specific directory (sample) first.

Feel free to ask questions, inform me about issues and add your own samples at any time.
